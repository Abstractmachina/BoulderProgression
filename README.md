# Boulder Progression
## Introduction
Boulder Progression is an app for my personal climbing training use. Based on the framework outlined by Steve Bechtel in his book _Logical Progression_, Boulder Progression quantifies climbing training (more specifically, bouldering training) which, as any climber knows, is an exceptionally difficult task compared to other sports. To progress in any sport, the basic principle of progressive overload and balanced recovery applies. Boulder Progression seeks to make climbing training quantifiable and, thus, measurable to achieve these principles by focusing on a few key metrics:
* Grade Sum (VSum): An indicator of work volume (e.g. V2+V2+V2+V3+V3+V4+V5 = V21). V0 is counted as 1. Focus on this when training for __work capacity or all-day endurance__.
* Average Grade (VAvg): An indicator of intensity. VSum divided by number of problems (e.g. V21/7 = V3). For the same VSum, if the VAvg is higher, it means the session was more intense in terms of effort. Focuson on this when training for __strength & power__.
* Session Density (VDen): Vsum / session length. Focus on this for training __power endurance__.
